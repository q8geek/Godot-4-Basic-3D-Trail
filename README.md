# Godot 3D Trail in C#

Because I've seen a lot of Trail made in GDScript and none in C#, I figured I might as well just rewrite the existing ones in C# and make them available to everyone.

I translated [metanoia83's Motion Trail](https://github.com/metanoia83/Godot-4.0-Motion-Trail) which was based on [dbp8890's Godot 3's Motion Trail](https://github.com/dbp8890/motion-trails).


## Features

- A boolean value to enable/disable trailing
- Setting start and end's colours and widths
- Easing trail's width
- Determine distance needed to add a new segment to the line
- Lifespan for each segment


## Installation

To use this script:

1. Copy `Trail.cs` to your project's folder
2. Create a `MeshInstance3D` Node
3. Attach `Trail.cs` to the created node
4. Have fun!
